# TO-DO-List
To-Do List Web App 📝✅  I built a To-Do List using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The app features a clean UI and uses local storage to save tasks, ensuring they remain even after refreshing the page. This project helped me practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and JavaScript logic. 🚀✨
